## Why I Built This Project
I created QueoteCraft because I wanted my friends, family, and anyone who loves quotes to have a single place to find daily inspiration. Instead of searching for quotes on social media or messaging apps, you can now access them instantly, anytime, anywhere.

## Description
QueoteCraft is built using the modern **MERN-inspired** stack: React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. All quotes are organized by language and author, making it easy to find what you need. The app is fully responsive and easy to customize.

**Features:**
- Add or edit quotes in `src/quotes.js`.
- Modern, clean UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Mobile-first, but looks great on desktop too.
- Anyone can view and enjoy the quotes for free.

## Future Scope
In the future, I want to add more categories, allow users to submit their own quotes, and maybe even add a login system so people can save their favorites. I hope to make QueoteCraft a go-to platform for inspiration for everyone, not just my college.
