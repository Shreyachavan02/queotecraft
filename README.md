## 💡 Why I Built This Project
In today's fast-paced world, finding reliable and uplifting content can be time-consuming. I built QueoteCraft to provide a centralized, distraction-free platform for accessing motivational and educational quotes in multiple languages. This project solves the problem of scattered resources by organizing quotes by language and author, making it easy for students, teachers, and anyone seeking inspiration to find what they need quickly and efficiently. 💬

## 📝 Description
QueoteCraft is built using the modern **MERN-inspired** stack: React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. All quotes are organized by language and author, making it easy to find what you need. The app is fully responsive and easy to customize.


**Features:**
- ✍️ Add or edit quotes in `src/quotes.js`.
- 🎨 Modern, clean UI with Tailwind CSS.
- 📱 Mobile-first, but looks great on desktop too.
- 🌍 Anyone can view and enjoy the quotes for free.

## 🚀 Future Scope
In the future, I want to add more categories, allow users to submit their own quotes, and maybe even add a login system so people can save their favorites. I hope to make QueoteCraft a go-to platform for inspiration for everyone, not just my college.
